#Pie Chart and 3D pie chart
# Bar Chart
# Box plot
# Histogram
# Line graph and multiple line graph
# Scatter plot

# Introduction
# Charts are used to generate visual representation of given data set 
# pie(arguments)
# pie(part,labels,edges,radius,clockwise,init.angle,density)
# part:vector of non-negative numeric values and tells the size of parts 
# labels:assign names to each part
# edges: used to change the outer circle of the pie; default value:200
#radius: used to set the radius; value is between -1 and 1; 
# init.angle: to specify initial angle in degrees, the default value is 0
# 
# using R pie chart demonstrate the percentage conveyance of various ways for travelling to office such as walking,bus,cycle and train
lbls=c("walking","bus","cycle","train")
pie(x=c(15,47,13,28),labels=lbls,radius=0.8,clockwise=FALSE,init.angle= 90,col=c("red","black","green","blue"))
legend("topright",fill=c("red","black","green","blue"),lbls)
 # legend(position.labels.fill)
# position states position of legend


# Using a chart legend show percentage conveyance of various ways for travelling to office such a swalking , car , bus, cycle, train,.
# 1 walking is assigned to red color, train is white color, car - blue color, bus- yellow car, cycle-green color but these values are assigned through cols nad lbls and the legend function
# 2 To fill parameter is used to assign colors to legend
# 3 Legend is added to top right side of the chart by assigning

#Bar plot
# barplot(part,names.arg,xlab,ylab,main,col)

# 8.4 Box Plot
# 
# The box plot is a method to graphically picture the numerical Information, gathered by p
# 
# Syntax
# 
# boxplot(arguments)
# 
# There are various arguments in boxplot, some of them are as follows: data: contains a list of data to design a box plot
# 
# x: data or values to draw the box plot
# 
# xlab: label for x-axis
# 
# ylab: label for y-axis
# 
# main: displays the title for the box plot
# 
# âš«col: used to assign color to the box plot.
# 
# notch: used to design a line on each side of the boxes; takes a Boolean value
